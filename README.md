# WHMCS Extensions

This project is storage for extending WHMCS, which is TheLab's Member Management system.

## About the Project

To manage members and guests for TheLab, we need to consider:
* Payment
  * New Member, Cancellation, Membership Points
* Badge
  * Automation with our Access Control System
* Waiver
  * All members and guests must sign an electronic waiver
* Commmunication
  * Reaching out to members for special events (elections, etc.)
* Voting
  * Is the member a voting member?
